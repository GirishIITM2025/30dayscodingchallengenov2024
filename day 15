Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.





class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        words = s.split()
        reversed_words = words[::-1]
        return ' '.join(reversed_words)
